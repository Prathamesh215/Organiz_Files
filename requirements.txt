# File Organization Tool Dependencies
# 
# This project uses only built-in Python libraries for maximum compatibility.
# However, if you want to build standalone executables, you'll need:

# For building executable files:
# pyinstaller>=5.0

# For development and testing:
# pytest>=7.0
# pytest-cov>=4.0

# For code formatting and linting:
# black>=22.0
# flake8>=5.0

# Note: tkinter comes built-in with Python, so no additional GUI dependencies needed!
